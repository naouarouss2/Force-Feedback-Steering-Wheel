# DIY FFB Steering Wheel
## What is it ? 🎮
A Force Feedback Wheelbase is a device used in car, truck, bus, or any other 3+ wheeled vehicle (as motorcycles require something different).

The difference between it and a standard game controller is, as the name suggests : **Force Feedback**

Force Feedback is what will create a physical connection between you and the game/simulator you're playing. It will allow you to feel every bump, road imperfection, steering stiffness, vibration... as if you're driving in real life.

## Features ✅
-  **Direct drive**, making it very silent, providing the most accurate and lossless feedback
-  **12-15Nm Force Feedback** (**5.7-7.1x** more powerful than the Logitech G29)
-  **12 Programmable buttons** (Depends on the wheel attached)
-  **Auto center**
-  **0.01125° sensitivity**, making it comparable to some high-end wheelbases on the market

## Why do I want to build it ? 🛠️
I have always wanted to have a simracing setup. Whenever I go to a mall or a gaming café and see a simracing setup, I run like a kid to try it.

I once tried a professional direct drive setup with a motion setup, and this really made me more excited about simracing.

The problem is that the only decent wheelbase available in Tunisia is the Logitech G29 family. They are pretty nice, but overpriced in Tunisia, and it really didn't really fill my heart and satisfy my requirements.

So I wanted to build my own wheelbase, tweaked to my likings and preferences, with endless upgrading and tuning options.

## 3D Design 🎨
I designed everything inside Solidworks, as I am pretty familiar with it, and I already have the CSWA certification.
I divided the design in 2 parts :
-  First, the wheelbase sub-assembly :

| **Full design** | **Aluminium machined parts** | **3D Printed parts** | **Commercial parts** |

## Wheelbase PCB ⚡
To minimize wiring and make things simpler and cleaner inside, I made a PCB for the wheelbase

## Disclaimer ⚠️

**This project is still under development.**

**Some parts and dimensions in the design should be fixed when I get my hands on the actual componens.**

**Firmware is still untested.**

**This wheelbase can output very high amounts of torque, that may cause injuries.**

**Building is not recommended until everything is made safe ans stable, and the project is completed.**

**If you want to build this project before completion, I would recommend switching from aluminium paddle shifters to 3D Printed ones using the same STEP files, and starting with low force feedback power until the system feels familiar and reassuring, or better, until I finish the development and make sure that the project is safe to use.**

## BOM 💵

This table format below is slightly different from what I originally made in Google Sheets. To to understand it better, I would recommend checking out [BOM.pdf](BOM.pdf)

All prices and shippings costs below are shown in **USD**. For local Tunisian shops, prices and costs were **converted from TND to USD**, based on the exchange rates between **17-12-2025** and **16-12-2025**.

Prices shown below are **non-discounted** prices. These may vary, especially on Aliexpress and other non-local shops.

Shipping costs shown below are **indicative**, based on what Aliexpress and other non-local shops/manufacturers displayed. **These costs may change**.

Articles shown as (x2) are originally only sold as single items, not a 2pcs bundle, with a x2 quantity. And that is done to show the most accurate pricing and shipping fee.
