# DIY FFB Steering Wheel
## What is it ?
A Force Feedback Wheelbase is a device used in car, truck, bus, or any other 3+ wheeled vehicle (as motorcycles require something different).

The difference between it and a standard game controller is, as the name suggests : **Force Feedback**

Force Feedback is what will create a physical connection between you and the game/simulator you're playing. It will allow you to feel every bump, road imperfection, steering stiffness, vibration... as if you're driving in real life.

## Features
-  **Direct drive**, making it very silent, providing the most accurate and lossless feedback
-  **12-15Nm Force Feedback** (**5.7-7.1x** more powerful than the Logitech G29)
-  **12 Programmable buttons** (Depends on the wheel attached)
-  **Auto center**
-  **0.01125° sensitivity**, making it comparable to some high-end wheelbases on the market

## Why do I want to make it ?
I have always wanted to have a simracing setup. Whenever I go to a mall or a gaming café and see a simracing setup, I run like a kid to try it.

I once tried a professional direct drive setup with a motion setup, and this really made me more excited about simracing.

The problem is that the only decent wheelbase available in Tunisia is the Logitech G29 family. They are pretty nice, but overpriced in Tunisia, and it really didn't really fill my heart and satisfy my requirements.

So I wanted to build my own wheelbase, tweaked to my likings and preferences, with endless upgrading and tuning options.

## 3D Design
I designed everything inside Solidworks, as I am pretty familiar with it, and I already have the CSWA certification.
I divided the design in 2 parts :
-  First, the wheelbase sub-assembly :

| **Full design** | **Aluminium machined parts** | **3D Printed parts** | **Commercial parts** |

-  Next, the steering wheel sub-assembly

## Wheelbase PCB
To minimize wiring and make things simpler and cleaner inside, I made a PCB for the wheelbase
